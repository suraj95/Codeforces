/*

Many years ago Berland was a small country where only ùëõ people lived. Each person had some savings: the 
i-th one had ai burles. The government considered a person as wealthy if he had at least X burles. To 
increase the number of wealthy people Berland decided to carry out several reforms. Each reform looked 
like that-

1. the government chooses some subset of people (maybe all of them);
2. the government takes all savings from the chosen people and redistributes the savings among the 
chosen people equally.

Input:
The first line contains single integer T (1‚â§T‚â§1000) ‚Äî the number of test cases. Next 2T lines contain the 
test cases ‚Äî two lines per test case. The first line contains two integers n and x (1‚â§n‚â§105, 1‚â§x‚â§109)
‚Äî the number of people and the minimum amount of money to be considered as wealthy. The second line 
contains n integers a1,a2, ..., an (1‚â§ai‚â§109) ‚Äî the initial savings of each person. It's guaranteed that 
the total sum of ùëõ doesn't exceed 105.

Output:
Print T integers ‚Äî one per test case. For each test case print the maximum possible number of wealthy 
people after several (maybe zero) reforms.
