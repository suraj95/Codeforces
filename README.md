## CodeForces Problems

This repository contains solutions to popular Codeforces problems. I was initially contributing to the Daily-Coding-Problems repository for my daily practice. It created by my colleague, for but updates on it were slow due to everyones busy schedule and commits to a forked repository don't count as contributions to Github. 

Most competitive programmers have terrible coding practices born out of the need to finish the code as fast as possible and the fact that you don’t expect someone else to read the code—— things like not using proper indentation or variable names. I will try my best to keep my code as readable as possible.
